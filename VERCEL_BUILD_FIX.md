# Vercel Build Fix Guide

## Problem
Your Vercel deployment is failing with `ERR_PNPM_OUTDATED_LOCKFILE` because the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file doesn't match `package.json` after adding Plaid dependencies.

## ‚úÖ Solution 1: Delete Lock File (RECOMMENDED - Already Done!)
The `pnpm-lock.yaml` file has been deleted from your repository. When you push this change to GitHub:
1. Vercel will automatically regenerate the lock file during the build
2. The build should succeed with the new dependencies installed
3. No terminal commands needed!

**Next Steps:**
1. Push this change to your `v3-final` branch
2. Vercel will automatically trigger a new deployment
3. The build should now succeed

## üîß Solution 2: Modify Vercel Build Settings (If Solution 1 Doesn't Work)

If deleting the lock file doesn't work, you can override the frozen-lockfile behavior:

### Option A: Change Install Command
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard: https://vercel.com/efkarpidis/boostedearnings-efkarpidis
2. Click **Settings** ‚Üí **General**
3. Scroll to **Build & Development Settings**
4. Find **Install Command** and click **Override**
5. Change from `pnpm install` to: `pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile`
6. Click **Save**
7. Redeploy from the **Deployments** tab

### Option B: Use Custom Build Command
1. In Vercel Settings ‚Üí **General** ‚Üí **Build & Development Settings**
2. Find **Build Command** and click **Override**
3. Set to: `pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile && pnpm build`
4. Click **Save**
5. Redeploy

## ‚öôÔ∏è Solution 3: Enable Corepack for pnpm@9 (Optional)

If you're using pnpm version 9+, enable Corepack in Vercel:

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **General**
2. Scroll to **Node.js Version**
3. Set to **20.x** or higher
4. Add Environment Variable:
   - Key: `ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_COREPACK`
   - Value: `1`
5. Click **Save**
6. Redeploy

---

## üìã Verification Steps

After applying any solution:
1. Go to **Deployments** tab in Vercel
2. Click **Redeploy** on the latest deployment
3. Watch the build logs for success
4. Look for: "Installing dependencies... ‚úì Dependencies installed"

## üö® If All Else Fails

Contact Vercel Support with this information:
- Project: `boostedearnings-efkarpidis`
- Branch: `v3-final`
- Error: `ERR_PNPM_OUTDATED_LOCKFILE`
- Dependencies added: `@plaid/react-plaid-link@latest`, `plaid@latest`

They can help override build settings or investigate further.

## ‚ú® Why This Happened

When you added Plaid dependencies to `package.json`, the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file wasn't updated to match. Vercel uses `--frozen-lockfile` by default to ensure consistent builds, which requires these files to be in sync.

By deleting the lock file, Vercel will generate a fresh one that matches your current `package.json`, resolving the conflict.
