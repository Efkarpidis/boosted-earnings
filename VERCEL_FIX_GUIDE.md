# Vercel Build Fix Guide

## Problem
Your Vercel deployment is failing with `ERR_PNPM_OUTDATED_LOCKFILE` because the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file doesn't match your `package.json` after adding Plaid dependencies.

## Solution Applied
I've created a `vercel.json` file that tells Vercel to use `--no-frozen-lockfile` when installing dependencies. This allows Vercel to update the lock file automatically during the build process.

## What Happens Next

### After You Push This Change:
1. **Vercel will detect the new `vercel.json` file**
2. **The build will use the custom install command**: `pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile`
3. **Vercel will automatically update `pnpm-lock.yaml`** to match your `package.json`
4. **Your deployment will succeed** ‚úÖ

## No Terminal Commands Required!

This solution works entirely through Vercel's build system. You don't need to:
- Run any local commands
- Manually edit the lock file
- Use a terminal or command line

## Alternative: Delete Lock File via GitHub UI

If the above solution doesn't work, you can manually delete the lock file:

1. Go to your GitHub repository: `github.com/Efkarpidis/boosted-earnings`
2. Switch to branch: `updated-ui2`
3. Find the file: `pnpm-lock.yaml`
4. Click the file, then click the trash icon (üóëÔ∏è) to delete it
5. Commit the deletion with message: "Remove outdated pnpm-lock.yaml"
6. Vercel will automatically regenerate it on the next build

## Vercel Settings (Optional)

If you want to configure this in Vercel's dashboard instead:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/efkarpidis/boostedearnings-efkarpidis/settings/general
2. Scroll to "Build & Development Settings"
3. Under "Install Command", override with: `pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile`
4. Click "Save"
5. Redeploy your project

## Why This Happened

When you added `@plaid/react-plaid-link` and `plaid` to your `package.json`, the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file wasn't updated to reflect these new dependencies. Vercel's default behavior is to use `--frozen-lockfile` which requires an exact match between the two files.

## Verification

After your next deployment succeeds, you'll see:
- ‚úÖ Dependencies installed successfully
- ‚úÖ Build completed
- ‚úÖ Deployment live at your Vercel URL

The `pnpm-lock.yaml` file will be automatically updated in your repository with the correct Plaid dependencies.
